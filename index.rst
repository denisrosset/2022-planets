=======================================================

Talk:

* Mostly us going through the website I've prepared and small demonstrations

* Much more content than what can be done in 45 minutes. Thus, you can pick what you
  need.

* I'll be available for the rest of the day.

* I'll be available Tue Apr 26 in the hotel lobby from 9:30am to noon; after lunch until
  2pm.
