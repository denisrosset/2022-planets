Integrated development environments
===================================

-  `Spyder IDE <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>`__ has great support for
   data science, but lacks in code navigation / refactoring /
   typechecking abilities.

-  `Atom <https://atom.io/>`__, with a design similar to VS Code;
   however, with Microsoft buying GitHub in 2018, most of the
   improvements are now made to VS Code

-  `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__ is a full-featured
   IDE. It offers slightly better refactoring options than VS Code. It
   requires a commercial license for some data science options, and is
   more heavy-weight than VS Code, but for its configuration and
   CPU/memory usage.

I'm personally using `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`, and members of the groups I am
working with have switched to it, sometimes keeping Spyder on the side.

Advantages of VS Code:

-  integrates well with modern Python tooling

-  handles multiple languages (including LaTeX!)

-  many extensions for Python-related tools

-  quite lightweight, both in resource use and user interface

Disadvantages:

-  designed for a single editor window (with split code panes), use with
   multiple monitors is
   `messy <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47260995/visual-studio-code-tabs-editors-of-the-same-project-in-multiple-screens>`__

-  the extension ecosystem needs a bit of curation, and itâ€™s easy to be
   overwhelmed by choices
