This extension collects the `TODO: xxx` comments through the project and displays them in a tree.

![tldraw screenshot](tldraw.png)

Excellent drawing tool, if your computer is equipped with a touchscreen.

I wasn't able to get pressure sensitivity working on Linux using a Huion tablet; and the [PNG export feature is missing](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/605) as of March 2022.

(latex_workshop)=

Complete LaTeX editing environment. 
Builds PDFs on the fly.

Math preview on mouse hover.

**Warning:** Includes its own PDF viewer, which conflicts with other PDF viewer extensions, so uninstall those if you installed them.
