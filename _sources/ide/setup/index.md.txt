# Setting up VS Code

First, general stuff.

1. Customize VS Code [appearance](appearance.md), including window/font size.

2. Deal with [telemetry settings](telemetry.md).

3. Install [spell checkers and set them up](spellcheck.md).

4. Select the [Python environment](environment.md) and install Python development dependencies.
