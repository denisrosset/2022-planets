First step: making a Python script
==================================

In this first step, we simply cut-and-paste the code in a ``.py`` file.

We added an `assertion <https://realpython.com/python-assert-statement/>`_ to verify the input
parameters of the code.

Assertions not only document your code (when they are placed in prominent places), and they are
also verified at runtime.

.. literalinclude:: root1.py

and we display the execution below.

.. command-output:: python typing/root1.py
