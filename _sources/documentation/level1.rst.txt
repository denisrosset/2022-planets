Level 1: documenting the code using a paper + Jupyter notebooks
===============================================================

For smaller projects, the documentation can be perfectly split between:

- An academic paper that provide a high-level description of the algorithm, its inputs and outputs.

  See :ref:`citation_github` to emphasize citation of your work.

- A few Jupyter notebooks providing example runs.

- Code comments, type annotations in the classes/functions that will be used by other people.
  (Think of moving your internal stuff in another Python file, in case you have a substantial
  of code that other people should not touch).

To work with those, VS Code provides a LaTeX extension (see :ref:`latex_workshop`) and an extension
to work with Jupyter files (see :ref:`ide_extensions`)
